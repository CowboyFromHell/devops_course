# Ansible assignment
## Create and deploy your own service
### The development stage:
For the true enterprise grade system we will need Python3, Flask and emoji support. Why on Earth would we create stuff that does not support emoji?!

* the service listens at least on port 80 (443 as an option)
* the service accepts GET and POST methods
* the service should receive `JSON` object and return strings in the following manner:
```
curl -XPOST -d'{"animal":"cow", "sound":"moooo", "count": 3}' http://myvm.localhost/
cow says moooo
cow says moooo
cow says moooo

curl -XPOST -d'{"animal":"elephant", "sound":"whoooaaa", "count": 5}' http://myvm.localhost/
elephant says whoooaaa
elephant says whoooaaa
elephant says whoooaaa
elephant says whoooaaa
elephant says whoooaaa
Made with ❤️ by %your_name
